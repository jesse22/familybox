A personal project I'm working on.

A simple private blogging system for my family to use to post pictures and images.
Facebook messages are too annoying to use for large group chats so I thought I could make something better.
I also wanted something I could host privately so as to not share my families data with Facebook.
It's still a work in progress but is currently functional.  Can upload images as well.
